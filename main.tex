\begin{abstract}
    What follows are my notes from the lectures and workshops I attended during the 2020 (online) International Conference on the Representation of Algebras. None of what follows is my own work besides the typing and any errors in transcription are my own.
    
    Workshops are three-lecture series that I will include all under the same section. There are also one-off lectures that will be in their own section.
